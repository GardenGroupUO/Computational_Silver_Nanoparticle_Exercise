# Online Computational Nanochemistry Notebook: A Computational Exercise for the Silver Nanoparticle Experiment

Nanotechnology is a branch of chemistry that is being used in many applications to solves major problems in the world. For examples:

- In medicine, nanoparticles are used in drug delivery and in contrast agents in MRI machines.
- In cosmetics, titanium oxide nanoparticles are use in sunscreens to protect your skin from UV light.
- In the clothing industry, silver nanoparticles are used in materials for antibacterial purposes.
- In light applications and in are, metallic nanoparticles are used because their colour can be controlled by their size and shape.

## How to use these notebooks

These notebooks are run in Google Colabs, which works like Microsoft Word but you can also perform computer programs with them. We will be using a computer program called Python to analyse nanoparticles. 

**Click on the *Open in Colab* button below.** This will open a notebook in Google Colab, and will tell you what to do next!

**Note: When you click the *Open in Colab* button, you may be ask that you need allow access to "Google Colabs".** If asked, allow Google Colabs to work with your Google Account. 

Google Colabs only run on a website. **Google Colab will not be installed on your computer and will not install anything on your computer.**

Have fun!

<!-- ## Worksheet Lessons

In this online lesson, we will learn what nanoparticles are, what they look like and what determines their shape, and why nanoparticles of different sizes have different colours. This lesson has four parts. **Right click on each of the Parts button and open these parts in new tables as you go through the worksheets so you can move between each part during this lesson**.

### Part 1: Getting Started

In this section, we will learn some basics of computer programming in a programming language called "Python". We will also learn about to use these "Jupyter" worksheets which we will use for running our python programs, and the atomic simulation environment (ASE) package that we will use to make our nanoparticles.

### Part 2: Learning about Nanoparticles

In this section, we will learn what a nanoparticle is and what gives a nanoparticle its shape.

### Part 4: Make your own Nanoparticles

In this section, we will make our own nanoparticles using a genetic algorithm, designed to use the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution to make nanoparticles that we could see experimentally.
