In these cases, computational techniques can help along with experimental results to understand more about nanoparticles. \n","\n","In this exercise, we will use one of these computational techniques to create models of low energy nanoparticles that may exist experimentally. This is called the genetic algorithm, which uses Darwin's theory of evolution to both create new and unique nanoparticles, as well as refine those nanoparticles which are the lowest in energy. \n","\n","The genetic algorithm works as follows:\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data/blob/main/Images/Part_3.3/GA.png?raw=true\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"350\"/>\n","</center>\n","\n","1. We start with a population of nanoparticles of different structures. \n","2. We then make these nanoparticles together by mating two nanoparicles together to give an offspring that has structural features of the two parents, or mutating a nanoparticle by slightly perturbing it. This increases the size of the population.\n","3. The population is decreased back to its original size by removing those clusters that are \"least fit\". This means those nanoparticles that are highest in energy are removed from the population. This leaves only the lowest energy nanoparticles in the population.\n","\n","We repeat steps 2 and 3 multiple times, called generations. After performing the genetic algorithm for many generations, we hope the genetic algorithm has found many of the relavant low energy nanoparticles that may be observed experimentally.
