Nanoscience is particularly interesting because materials on the nanoscale show vastly different properties from the bulk. For instance, on the nanoscale, silver is no longer silver coloured but can be most of the colours of the rainbow!\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data/blob/main/Images/Silver_Nanoparticle/silver_nanoparticles.png?raw=true\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"900\"/>\n","</center>\n","\n","An extremely nice experiment has been designed by a team at Wilfred Laurier University, Canada, to make silver nanoprisms that give the colours in the picture above.

Therefore we have designed this computational exercise to help illustrate some of the principles of the nanoprism experiment, as well as nanoparticles more generally.
