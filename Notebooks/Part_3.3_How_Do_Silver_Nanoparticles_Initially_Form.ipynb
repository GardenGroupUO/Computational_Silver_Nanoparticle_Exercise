Ag<sup>+</sup> can not form nanoparticles becaue they are positively charge, meaning that one Ag<sup>+</sup> ion is electrically repelled from other Ag<sup>+</sup> ions. To make nanoparticles with Ag<sup>+</sup>, we need to reduce them so that they are not electrically charge. We do this using sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), which is a very good reducing agent.\n","\n","<center>\n","<font size=3>\n","NaBH<sub>4</sub> + 8AgNO<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O $\\rightarrow$ Na[B(OH)<sub>4</sub>] + 8Ag + 8H<sup>+</sup> + 8NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\n","</font>\n","</center>\n","\n","This allows us to make Ag nanoparticles. However, if we used only NaBH<sub>4</sub> to reduce silver, it would reduce Ag<sup>+</sup> to Ag so quickly we would make a silver mirror instead of Ag nanoparticles. \n","\n","To reduce the speed that Ag<sup>+</sup> is reduced to Ag, we also include hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to our solution which is an oxidising agent.

This H<sup>+</sup> is used by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to oxidise Ag back to Ag<sup>+</sup>. However, if we have too much H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will oxidise Ag back to Ag<sup>+</sup> too quickly!
