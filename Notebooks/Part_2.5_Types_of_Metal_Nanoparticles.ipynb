This can be because different metal atoms have different surface energies (<font size=2>$E_{S}$</font>) for their square and triangle surfaces. This means that some metals will prefer to form nanoparticles that contain more square surfaces, and other metals will prefer to form nanoparticles that contain more triangle surfaces.\n","\n","Square and triangle surface energies are often important to understand because these energies tell us how easy it is to create square and triangle surfaces. **The lower the surface energy, the less energy is required to make that type of surface**.\n","\n","We are often interested in the ratio of the square surface energy:triangle surface energy, which we will call the **square:triangle ratio**. The square:triangle ratio **is the ratio between the square surface energy and the triangle surface energy**. We are often interested in this ratio as it can help us understand what types of surfaces a particular metallic nanoparticle may likely contain:\n","\n","* The **larger** the square:triangle ratio, the less energy is required to make triangle surfaces, and therefore the more likely a nanoparticle will contain more **triangle surfaces**.\n","* The **smaller** the square:triangle ratio, the less energy is required to make square surfaces, the more likely a nanoparticle will contain more **square surfaces**.\n","\n","In the following section, we will look at what the most stable nanoparticles containing about 500 atoms look like for different types of metal elements.\n","\n","Below is the full python code for a script that will create a nanoparticle containing different metal atoms with around 500 atoms. **Try making different metal nanoparticles around 500 atoms in size and answer the following questions**: \n","\n","**Re-run the code with different metal by changing the element given in the ``element`` variable and press the <img src=\"https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data/blob/main/Images/stop_images/playsvg.png?raw=true\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"28\"/> button**"],"id":"bored-bennett"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lPiNNANOZlfM","cellView":"form"},"source":["#@markdown <font color=\"black\" size=\"+2\">‚Üê</font><font color=\"red\" size=\"+1\"> **Click the play button to load our prerequisite files**</font>\n","\n","!echo --------------------------------\n","!echo Installing python programs\n","!pip install ase==3.22.0 &> /dev/nul\n","!echo Completed installing python programs\n","!if [ -d Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data ]; then rm -Rf Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data; fi\n","!echo --------------------------------\n","!echo Downloading background python scripts from github\n","!git clone https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data &> /dev/nul\n","!echo Completed downloading background python scripts from github\n","!echo --------------------------------"],"id":"lPiNNANOZlfM","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"580a79c8"},"source":["import os\n","if not os.path.exists('/content/Computational_Silver_Nanoparticle_Exercise_Data'):\n","    message = 'Could not load files.
