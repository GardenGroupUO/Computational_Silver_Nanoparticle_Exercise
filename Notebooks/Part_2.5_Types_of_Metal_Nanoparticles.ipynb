Generally the square faces are less stable; therefore we usually see larger triangle faces on nanoparticles. However, the stability of these square faces differ between different types of metals. This consequently causes different metallic nanoparticles to have different shapes.\n","\n","<!Not all metals will form the same types of nanoparticles. This can be because different metal atoms have different surface energies  for their square and triangle surfaces. This means that some metals will prefer to form nanoparticles that contain more square surfaces, and other metals will prefer to form nanoparticles that contain more triangle surfaces.>\n","\n","<!Square and triangle surface energies are often important to understand because these energies tell us how easy it is to create square and triangle surfaces. **The lower the surface energy, the less energy is required to make that type of surface**.>\n","\n","We can quantify the relative stability of the square face to the triangle face. We will call this **<font size=2><font color=\"green\" size=\"\">$(E_{stab,square})$</font></font>**.\n","\n","<!We are often interested in the ratio of the square surface energy:triangle surface energy, which we will call the **square:triangle ratio**. The square:triangle ratio **is the ratio between the square surface energy and the triangle surface energy**. We are often interested in this ratio as it can help us understand what types of surfaces a particular metallic nanoparticle may likely contain:>\n","\n","* The <font color=\"195EBC\" size=\"\">**larger**</font> **<font size=2><font color=\"green\" size=\"\">$E_{stab,square}$</font></font>**, the less stable the square face is, relative to the triangle face.
