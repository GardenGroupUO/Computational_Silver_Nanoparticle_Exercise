Python3 is a programming language used for many applications, including scientific research. A programming language is used to instruct your computer to run a set of instructions (called a script) to produce outputs. For example, if we were writing the instructions for walking, these are instructions that we would write into our walking code: \n","\n","1. Begin with both feet on the ground.\n","2. Decide the direction you want to move to.\n","3. Lift right foot off the ground and move it infront of you.\n","4. Place right foot in front of you.\n","5. Lift left foot off the ground and move it infront of you.\n","6. Place left foot in front of you.\n","7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until you reach your destination.\n","\n","This sounds very abstract and a bit confusing don't worry, we will get use to using python as we work through these notebooks. If you are nervous about coding, don't worry you will not be expected to know any coding before doing these notebooks.
